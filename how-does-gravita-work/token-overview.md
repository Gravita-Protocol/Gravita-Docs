# Token Overview

## What is $GRAI?

$GRAI is an over-collateralized debt token issued by Gravita Protocol. GRAI can be minted by depositing collateral on Gravita Protocol.

### Hard price ceiling

GRAI's Vessels' maximum LTV of 90% with WETH as a collateral creates a natural price ceiling at $1.10.&#x20;

When GRAI exchange rate exceeds that level, borrowers can make an instant profit by borrowing the maximum amount against their collateral and selling GRAI on the market for more than $1.10.&#x20;

If 1 GRAI trades at $1.20 for example, you can lock up $2200 worth of the LST of your choice, take out a loan of 2000 GRAI and sell it for $2400. No matter if your loans gets liquidated or not, you have made an arbitrage gain of $200.

Since also bLUSD is a supported collateral asset against which users can borrow at up top 99% TVL, GRAI hard ceiling price could also theoretically be considered $ 1.01. However this specific collateral asset will have mint caps in place to avoid excessive sell pressure on GRAI.

### Hard price floor

The ability to redeem GRAI for collateral at 0.97 (i.e. 1 GRAI for $0.97 worth of collateral) creates a hard price floor, below which arbitrage opportunities become profitable.&#x20;

We call these "hard peg mechanisms" since they are based on direct processes.&#x20;

This offers to the user a more forgiving margin to avoid redemption. More importantly, it allows GRAI to not regularly be over peg, which can over time make the implementation of GRAI less desirable.

Early users should keep in mind that redemptions will not be possible at launch. However liquidations will of course be enabled directly at launch.
