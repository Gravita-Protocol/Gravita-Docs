## Gravita Ascend: Chapter 1 - Now Finished

Gravita Ascend offers a dynamic shift from the conventional to a vast interstellar DeFi experience. As you navigate through this program, you will come across various opportunities to earn "Marks," our reward points. Let's delve into the specifics of this intricate journey.

***

**1. Primary Missions**

Your journey will comprise of several core activities:

* **Maintaining an Active Vessel:** It's paramount to ensure that your Vessel stays open throughout the course so that you keep earning Marks. Opening a Vessel is rewarded only once throughout the entire program. This activity earns Marks based on the size and duration of the position.
* **Providing to the Stability Pool:** Participants are invited to contribute GRAI to the Stability Pool, earning Marks based on the size and duration of their allocation.
* **Engage in Liquidity Operations:** Users have the chance to allocate GRAI to designated Liquidity Pools, earning Marks based on the size and duration of their allocation.

Remember, all activities are quantified both by size and duration. And the beauty of Gravita Ascend? Marks are attributed retroactively and uniformly across every platform and blockchain.

***

**2. Secondary Missions: Additional Adventures**

Apart from the primary tasks, there are more avenues to explore:

* **Vessel Launch:** Initiate and maintain your Vessel. Remember: opening a Vessel is rewarded only once throughout the entire program. K
* **Galxe Social Campaign:** Engage actively with our community-driven campaign.
* **Possess a Unique POAP:** Holding one of our special POAPs gives you an added advantage.

## Chapter 2: Race to the Beacon

1. **The Ascend Leaderboard**

Building on similar principles as Chapter 1, embark on a journey where your actions carve your path to glory in the Gravita cosmos. The Ascend Leaderboard is where valor and strategy merge, rewarding pioneers for their dedication and cunning.

* **Active Vessel Command:** Your foremost mission is to maintain an active Vessel. The longevity and robustness of your Vessel not only symbolize your commitment but are also rewarded with Marks, reflecting the size and tenure of your command.
* **Stability Pool Contributions:** Venture further by contributing GRAI to the Stability Pool. This crucial operation ensures the ecosystem's stability and is acknowledged with Marks, honoring both the magnitude and duration of your contributions.
* **Liquidity Operations:** The cosmos thrives on liquidity. Allocate GRAI into designated Liquidity Pools, and receive Marks as a testament to your contributions. Like stars in the sky, each operation is measured by its size and duration, illuminating your path on the leaderboard.

These primary missions form the core of your interstellar endeavor, with Marks awarded retroactively, ensuring fairness across all realms of our vast DeFi universe.

2. **Navigating the Time Distortion**

As the Race to the Beacon unfolds, adventurers find themselves amidst a cosmic anomalyâ€”a gravitational field that warps time itself. This distortion creates a labyrinth of temporal puzzles, challenging your perception and strategy.

* **The Anomaly's Challenge:** The gravitational distortion affects our countdown to The Genesis Expedition, rendering it a dynamic and fluctuating puzzle. Events and milestones may shift unexpectedly, demanding adaptability and foresight from all participants.
* **Adapting to Flux:** Success in this chapter requires more than steadfastness; it demands agility. As time expands and contracts, so too must your strategies. Embrace the uncertainty of the anomaly, and let it guide your mission strategies and collaborations.
* **A Cosmic Opportunity:** This temporal puzzle isn't just a challenge; it's an opportunity. It allows for unique strategies and unexpected alliances, as participants navigate the fluctuating tides of time to secure their ascent on the leaderboard.

In Chapter 2 of Gravita Ascend, the race transcends conventional boundaries, inviting you into a realm where time bends to the will of the cosmos. Will you harness the anomaly, adapt your strategies, and ascend as a legend in the Gravita universe? The beacon awaits, and with it, the chance to etch your name among the stars.
