Before whitelisting any new collaterals, our team follows a multi-step process.

In order to preserve the safety of the protocol and the core value propositions of GRAI and GRVT, only non-censorable assets can be supported on the main version of Gravita Protocol.&#x20;

Please contact us at marketing \[at] gravitaprotocol.com if you wish to reach Gravita Protocol users with your token.
